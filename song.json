Once upon a time
Not so long ago

Tommy used to work on the docks
Union's been on strike
He's down on his luck; it's tough
So tough
Gina works the diner all day
Working for her man
She brings home her pay for love
For love

She says we've got to hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other, and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot

Oh, we're half way there
Whoa-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear
Whoa-oh, livin' on a prayer

Tommy's got his six string in hock
Now he's holding in what he used
To make it talk so tough
It's tough
Gina dreams of running away
When she cries in the night Tommy whispers
Baby it's okay
Someday

We've got to hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other, and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot

Oh, we're half way there
Whoa-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear
Whoa-oh, livin' on a prayer

Livin' on a prayer!

We've got to hold on
Ready or not
You live for the fight when that's all that you've got

Whoa, we're half way there
Whoa-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Whoa-oh, livin' on a prayer

Whoa, we're half way there
Whoa-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Whoa-oh, livin' on a prayer

Whoa, we're half way there
Whoa-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
